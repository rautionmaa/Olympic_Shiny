# Olympic_Shiny

This Shiny App visualizes and analyzes data on the Olympic Games from 1896 to 2016. Data is from: https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results.

Data includes athelete name,	gender,	age, height, weight, team,	NOC(country),	games,	year,	season,	city,	sport,	event, and medal. I used GoogleVis to visualize a world map with medals by country. I also made a map with historical host cities. I analyzed athelete height, weight and age against gender, sport and medals. I also created charts visualizing top countries by sport and top atheletes by country. All code was written in R.
