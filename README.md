# Olympic_Shiny

This Shiny App visualizes and analyzes data on the Olympic Games from 1896 to 2016.

Data is from: https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results.

Data includes athlete name, gender, age, height, weight, team, NOC (country), games, year, season, city, sport, event, and medal. Winter and Summer Olympics were held in the same year until 1994 (Lillehammer, Norway) when they began alternating every two years. I used GoogleVis to visualize a world map with medals by country. I also made a map with historical host cities. I analyzed athlete height, weight and age against gender, sport and medals. I also created charts visualizing top countries by sport and top athletes by country. All code was written in R.
